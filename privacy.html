    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      SJ Consultation ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the
      personal information you provide when using our website, requesting consultations, or receiving our services.
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, store, and protect personal information and
      how you can exercise your privacy rights.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope & Applicability</h2>
    <p>
      This policy applies to personal information collected by SJ Consultation in the course of our commercial activities,
      including through this website, email, telephone, and in-person consultations. If you receive services from another
      legal entity or partner of SJ Consultation, additional privacy terms may apply.
    </p>

    <h2>Age Requirement for Legal Services</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 18 years old to request or receive legal or other restricted services from SJ Consultation.
      If you are under 18, we will not provide legal services directly; a parent or legal guardian must contact us and
      provide consent on your behalf.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We collect only the personal information necessary to provide our services. With your consent, we collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used for appointment logistics, communications, and verification (collected with consent).</li>
      <li><strong>Phone number</strong> — used for appointment scheduling, urgent communications, and verification (collected with consent).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal name</strong> — used to identify the person requesting services and to create service records.</li>
      <li><strong>Location</strong> — city, province/state, and country as needed for service delivery, jurisdictional matters, or logistics.</li>
      <li><strong>Billing information</strong> — when you request paid services, we may collect billing details necessary to process payments (for example, invoicing or payment card details processed via our payment processor).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not collect government-issued identification (for example, driver’s licenses or passports) as part of routine intake.
      Billing information is collected only where required to arrange or process payments and is handled in accordance with this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
    <p>
      We use personal information for purposes that include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, administering and improving our services and consultations.</li>
      <li>Verifying consent and contacting clients regarding appointments or service updates.</li>
      <li>Processing payments, invoices and related financial administration.</li>
      <li>Complying with legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations.</li>
      <li>Security, recordkeeping, and internal business operations (including analytics and trend analysis).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Consent & Legal Basis</h2>
    <p>
      SJ Consultation collects certain contact and billing details only with your consent. Under applicable privacy rules and guidance,
      consent must be meaningful — you will be informed of the purpose and use of your information and will have the option to decline
      or withdraw consent where permitted by law. We will not use your information for purposes beyond those disclosed without obtaining
      further consent or other lawful basis. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
    </p>

    <h2>Verification & Security</h2>
    <p>
      To maintain service integrity and prevent misuse we may use email- or phone-based verification methods (for example, one-time codes).
      We implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect personal information, including access controls, secure servers,
      and staff training. Billing information processed for payments is handled via our third-party payment processor and is not retained longer
      than necessary for billing, accounting, or legal requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Collection Limits & Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We limit collection to only the personal information necessary for the purposes identified. Personal information is retained only
      as long as required to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, to satisfy legal or regulatory obligations, or to resolve disputes.
      Typical retention periods will vary depending on the nature of the records and applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      We may disclose personal information to third parties in limited circumstances, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service providers and vendors who perform services for us (hosting, payment processing, analytics, communications).</li>
      <li>Professional advisors, courts, regulators or law enforcement where required by law or in connection with legal claims.</li>
      <li>Other organizations with your consent or at your direction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We require third-party service providers to implement reasonable privacy and security safeguards and to process personal information
      only for the purposes we authorize.
    </p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Personal information we collect may be stored and processed in countries outside your country of residence. Where information is
      transferred across borders, we will take reasonable steps to ensure it remains protected in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy
      and applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <p>
      Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access personal information we hold about you and obtain a copy of it.</li>
      <li>Request correction or update of inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent to processing where processing is based on consent (withdrawal may affect our ability to provide services).</li>
      <li>Request deletion of personal information, subject to legal retention requirements.</li>
      <li>Object to or restrict certain processing activities where applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>PIPEDA and Complaints</h2>
    <p>
      If PIPEDA applies to our handling of your personal information (for example, where we operate in Canada and engage in commercial activity),
      individuals have rights including the right to access their information, to request corrections, and to challenge an organization’s compliance
      with fair information principles. You may file a complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada if you are not satisfied
      with our response to a privacy concern. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    </p>

    <h2>Data Breach Notification</h2>
    <p>
      If we determine that a breach of personal information has occurred that creates a real risk of significant harm to affected individuals,
      we will notify those individuals and the relevant regulator as required by law and include information about the breach, its potential effects,
      and measures taken to mitigate harm. PIPEDA includes breach notification obligations for organizations subject to the Act. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies & Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Our website uses cookies and similar technologies for essential functionality, analytics, and to improve user experience. You may control
      or disable cookies through your browser settings; disabling some cookies may affect site functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our website may contain links to third-party websites and services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party sites.
